    <h2>How the USA Celebrates Halloween</h2>
    <p>Let‚Äôs uncover the traditions that make Halloween a standout celebration in the United States.</p>

    <h3>Pumpkins Everywhere <span class="pumpkin">üéÉ</span></h3>
    <img src="carvedpumpkins.webp" alt="Pumpkins" class="spooky-image">
    <p> From decorations to desserts, pumpkins dominate the Halloween season. This tradition stems from the Irish legend of Jack O'Lantern, the crafty blacksmith who tricked the devil but was barred from both heaven and hell. Left to wander the earth with his lantern, Jack‚Äôs tale inspired the practice of carving lanterns. Initially, turnips were used in Ireland, but in America, pumpkins‚Äîlarger and easier to carve‚Äîbecame the new standard. Their bright orange color and abundance during fall sealed their place as a Halloween icon.</p>

    <h3>Over-the-Top Decorations</h3>
    <p>Americans don‚Äôt just carve pumpkins‚Äîthey transform their homes into haunted masterpieces. From spiderwebs and skeletons to makeshift graveyards, the Halloween decorating craze covers windows, fences, trees, and lawns. The classic colors orange and black represent the autumn harvest and death, respectively, amplifying the spooky atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Costumes Galore</h3>
    <p>Halloween costumes are a beloved tradition that echoes the Samhain custom of disguising oneself to evade spirits. Early 20th-century pranksters also donned masks to conceal their identities. Today, costumes have evolved into a creative and attention-grabbing art form. The scarier or more extravagant the outfit, the better! Many costumes even blend horror with playful sex appeal, showcasing an undeniably American twist.</p>

    <h3>Trick-or-Treating</h3>
    <p>The phrase "trick or treat" captures the spirit of American Halloween. Children, dressed in costume, visit house after house demanding candy. This practice likely derives from the Celtic belief that leaving food outside appeased wandering spirits. By the 1950s, the candy industry capitalized on the holiday, creating specialized sweets for Halloween. Today, sugary staples like candy corn and candy apples ensure that costumed visitors are rewarded for their efforts.</p>

<div class="brazil-section section">
    <h2>Saci Perer√™ Day ‚óè Folklore Celebration</h2>
    <p>A very Brazilian twist on Halloween is the celebration of Saci Perer√™, a beloved character from Brazilian folklore. Saci is a mischievous, one-legged creature known for playing pranks, wearing a red cap, and causing harmless trouble. On October 31st, Saci Perer√™ Day is celebrated alongside Halloween, especially in regions that embrace Brazilian traditions.</p>

    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <p>Children might dress up as Saci or other folklore characters like Cuca (a witch), Curupira (a forest guardian), or Boitat√° (a fire serpent). There are storytelling sessions where families gather to share Saci‚Äôs tales and other folklore legends, keeping the Brazilian mythical world alive during Halloween.</p>

    <h2>Haunted Houses and Horror Experiences</h2>
    <p>While theme parks like Hopi Hari and Beto Carrero World feature Halloween-themed events, there are also pop-up haunted houses that take a Brazilian horror approach. These might feature not just international ghosts, but folklore monsters like Z√© do Caix√£o, a character from Brazilian horror films.</p>

    <h3>Immersive Experiences</h3>
    <p>Some cities, like S√£o Paulo, organize immersive horror experiences where participants are fully engaged in spooky scenarios inspired by Brazilian myths and horror films. This could include a haunted forest experience based on A Ilha do Medo, a Brazilian horror story, or visits to abandoned colonial houses that are said to be haunted by ghosts from Brazil‚Äôs history.</p>
